# mvcheezburger
A cheezburger tracking app performed in Node/Express/MySQL/Handlebars.

Sometimes, we have cheezburgers. 

Sometimes, we're not sure where the cheezburgers go - did we eat them? Were they taken by the Fair Folk? 

mvcheezburger is a way to help track where your cheezburgers have been and will be, and to observe the malleable nature of reality.

A cheezburger that has been devoured may again be available in the future!

## Demo
A demo of the app can be found here:
