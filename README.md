## About
A cheezburger tracking app, created with Node/Express/MySQL/Handlebars.

Sometimes, we have cheezburgers. 

Sometimes, we're not sure where the cheezburgers go - did we eat them? Were they taken by the Fair Folk? 

mvcheezburger is a way to help track where your cheezburgers have been and will be, and to observe the malleable nature of reality.

## Demo
